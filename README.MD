# Sorting Material Design Icons

### Current directory tree:
```
material-design-icons
|
+--category (e.g action)
   |
   +--screen pixel density (e.g drawable-mdpi)
      |
      +--icon (e.g ic_3d_rotation_black_18dp.png)
```

This makes it difficult to locate and copy each icon especially if you need all different pixel densities.

### What I propose:
```
material-design-icons
|
+--category (e.g action)
   |
   +--icon name (e.g ic_3d_rotation_black_18dp.png)
      |
      +--icon pixel density(.e.g 18dp)
         |
         +--screen pixel density (e.g drawable-mdpi)
            |
            +icon (e.g ic_3d_rotation_black_18dp.png)
```

It makes it easier to locate icons

### How to use:

```
$ ./sort-icons.py /path/to/icons
```

You will find the icons in ```sorted``` folder in ```/path/to/icons/```
